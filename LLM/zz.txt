- does "scope" and "requirement" means missing headings? and what other keywords says so
- is the format consistent with each file?
- what are the meaning of the classification and should we consider them
- files with problems: IEC 61508-3-1
- when droping the md file, is it a single part or is it all of them

- what does standard atlas is all about in the grand theme of things
- do i need to modify the code or just add mine
- how to integrate the tree structure with the ability to generate headings


what should we do:
- scope and other is a missing title
- we should contanerize the app to run  of every computer (maybe use docker)
- add a seprate directory under tools for our project

What we added from last time:
- parsed the files from the data directory of standart atlas and show the tree for each part
- added an option to drop the data file in adition to the markdown
- we can navigate through different parts of the tree
- right click on a node to redirect to the content

What should we do to finish:
- adjust the height according to the number of nodes.
- add headings to a specific node and not just for the whole document.
- solve the refresh problem.
- redirecting to the same page and not creating a new one everytime.
- save the progress (for example as a json file).
- improve header generation.
* containerize the web aplication so that it would work on different devices (for example by using docker)
* finalize and optimize the code (remove redundancy and clean the code and test it)
* add the code to the standart atlas as a separate directory in tools

Things to consider:
- the parsing depends on the format of the data

what should we add to the presentation
- the progress of the project - what we did and what we didn't
- the reesults of everything
- show a live demo
- add a user guide to how to use it
