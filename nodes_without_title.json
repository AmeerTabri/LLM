    "content": "\nA characteristic feature in many railway systems is the need to design each installation to meet the individual requirements for a specific application. A system configured by application data and/or by application algorithms allows approved generic software to be customised with the individual requirements for each specific application.\n\nThe objective for the development of application data is the correct deriving of the data from the given installation and the check of the intended behaviour, followed by an assessment of the used development process for that application data.\n\nThe requirements for the development of application algorithms are the same as the development of generic software as described in Clauses 1-7 and 9.\n\nA typical example is a system whose generic software is pre-configured for a generic railway application by a set of application algorithms, and which is then further configured to each specific installation by instantiation and interconnection of the application algorithms and by a set of configuration data. For instance, the signalling principles of an interlocking system (e.g. signal management, point management) may be implemented by a set of application algorithms.\n\nApplication data typically take the form of parameter values or descriptions (identity, type, location, etc.) of external objects. Application algorithms may take the form of e.g. function block diagrams, state charts and relay ladder diagrams, which determine the desired response of the system according to its inputs, its current state and specific parameter values. Application algorithms include logical connections and operations to be executed.\n\nThe application data/algorithms are usually produced using dedicated tools. They may be expressed in tabular or diagrammatic formats, which can be interpreted or compiled into executable codes often after conversion into source codes handled via specialised languages (with syntax and semantics).\n\nThe customisation of systems through configurability gives the designer different degrees of control over the detailed software functionality.\n\n"
